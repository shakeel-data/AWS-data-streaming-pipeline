A Data Streaming Pipeline in AWS enables the real-time processing and movement of data from sources like databases, applications, or IoT devices to storage or analytics systems. It ensures low-latency data flow, supports scalable ingestion with services like Kafka (MSK) and processing with AWS Glue, Kinesis, or Spark. This is crucial for real-time analytics, monitoring, fraud detection, and event-driven applications, helping businesses make faster and more accurate decisions.
